## About Me

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am broadly interested in meta-learning, online learning, 
and data-centric AI for foundation models. My previous work mainly focus on data-driven applications including time series forecasting and recommender systems. I recently worked on Agentic AI at Tongyi Lab, Alibaba Group, and I am currently working on multi-modal time series reasoning at ByteDance.
