abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation is the task of predict the next item
  that the user is most likely to interact with based on past sequential behavior
  from multiple domains. One of the key challenges in cross-domain sequential recommendation
  is to grasp and transfer the flow of information from multiple domains so as to
  promote recommendations in all domains. Previous studies have investigated the flow
  of behavioral information by exploring the connection between items from different
  domains. The flow of knowledge (i.e., the connection between knowledge from different
  domains) has so far been neglected. In this article, we propose a mixed information
  flow network for cross-domain sequential recommendation to consider both the flow
  of behavioral information and the flow of knowledge by incorporating a behavior
  transfer unit and a knowledge transfer unit. The proposed mixed information flow
  network is able to decide when cross-domain information should be used and, if so,
  which cross-domain information should be used to enrich the sequence representation
  according to usersâ€™ current preferences. Extensive experiments conducted on four
  e-commerce datasets demonstrate that the proposed mixed information flow network
  is able to improve recommendation performance in different domains by modeling mixed
  information flow. In this article, we focus on the application of mixed information
  flow networks to a scenario with two domains, but the method can easily be extended
  to multiple domains.
